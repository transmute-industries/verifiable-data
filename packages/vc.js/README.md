```

### Create Verifiable Credential

Also known as credential issuance.

This library supports issuing in as a `vc` or `vc-jwt`.

```ts
import {
  JsonWebKey,
  JsonWebSignature,
  JsonWebKey2020,
} from "@transmute/json-web-signature";
import { documentLoader } from "path/somewhere";
import { verifiable } from "@transmute/vc.js";

const key = {
  id: "did:key:z6MkokrsVo8DbGDsnMAjnoHhJotMbDZiHfvxM4j65d8prXUr#z6MkokrsVo8DbGDsnMAjnoHhJotMbDZiHfvxM4j65d8prXUr",
  type: "JsonWebKey2020",
  controller: "did:key:z6MkokrsVo8DbGDsnMAjnoHhJotMbDZiHfvxM4j65d8prXUr",
  publicKeyJwk: {
    kty: "OKP",
    crv: "Ed25519",
    x: "ijtvFnowiumYMcYVbaz6p64Oz6bXwe2V_9IlCgDR_38",
  },
  privateKeyJwk: {
    kty: "OKP",
    crv: "Ed25519",
    x: "ijtvFnowiumYMcYVbaz6p64Oz6bXwe2V_9IlCgDR_38",
    d: "ZrHpIW1JBb-sK2-wzKV0mQjbxpnxjUCu151QZ9_F_Vs",
  },
};

const credential = {
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020/v1",
  ],
  id: "http://example.edu/credentials/3732",
  type: ["VerifiableCredential"],
  issuer: {
    id: "did:key:z6MkokrsVo8DbGDsnMAjnoHhJotMbDZiHfvxM4j65d8prXUr",
  },
  issuanceDate: "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  credentialSubject: {
    id: "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
  },
};

const result = await verifiable.credential.create({
  credential,
  format: ["vc", "vc-jwt"],
  documentLoader: documentLoader,
  suite: new JsonWebSignature({
    key: await JsonWebKey.from(key as JsonWebKey2020),
  }),
});
```

### Create Verifiable Presentation

```ts
import {
  JsonWebKey,
  JsonWebSignature,
  JsonWebKey2020,
} from "@transmute/json-web-signature";
import { documentLoader } from "path/somewhere";
import { key } from "path/somewhere";
import { verifiable } from "@transmute/vc.js";

const presentation = {
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020/v1",
  ],
  type: ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  holder: {
    id: key.controller,
  },
};

const result = await verifiable.presentation.create({
  presentation,
  format: ["vp", "vp-jwt"],
  documentLoader: documentLoader,
  challenge: "123", // this is supplied by the verifier / presentation recipient
  suite: new JsonWebSignature({
    key: await JsonWebKey.from(fixtures.key as JsonWebKey2020),
  }),
});
```

### Verify Presentation

```ts
import {
  JsonWebKey,
  JsonWebSignature,
  JsonWebKey2020,
} from "@transmute/json-web-signature";
import { documentLoader } from "path/somewhere";
import { verifiable } from "@transmute/vc.js";
import { presentation } from "path/somewhere";

const result = await verifiable.presentation.verify({
  presentation,
  format: ["vp", "vp-jwt"],
  documentLoader: documentLoader,
  challenge: "123", // this is supplied by the verifier / presentation recipient
  suite: new JsonWebSignature(),
});
```

### Verify Credential

```ts
import {
  JsonWebKey,
  JsonWebSignature,
  JsonWebKey2020,
} from "@transmute/json-web-signature";
import { documentLoader } from "path/somewhere";
import { verifiable } from "@transmute/vc.js";
import { credential } from "path/somewhere";

const result = await verifiable.credential.verify({
  credential,
  format: ["vc", "vc-jwt"],
  documentLoader: documentLoader,
  suite: [new JsonWebSignature()],
});
```

### About

This library has been adapted from older versions of [digitalbazaar/vc](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vc).

The primary changes have been adding support for vc-jwt, changes to validation and documentLoader requirements.
